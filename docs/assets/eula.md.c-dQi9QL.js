If User does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, they shall not download or use the Application.</p><p>The subject matter of this EULA is the licensing of Application to User. <u>The Application is licensed, not sold</u>.</p><h2 id="license" tabindex="-1">License <a class="header-anchor vp-link" href="#license" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;License&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Licensor grants User a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download, install and use the Application for personal and commercial purposes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p><h2 id="user-s-rights-and-obligations" tabindex="-1">User&#39;s Rights and Obligations <a class="header-anchor vp-link" href="#user-s-rights-and-obligations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;User&#39;s Rights and Obligations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>User may use the licensed Application only for its intended purpose.</p><p>Licensor grants to the User a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Application to integrate it <u>only as incorporated and embedded components of electronic games and digital media</u> and distribute such electronic game and digital media; reproduction and display in distributed physical advertising materials is permitted solely for marketing purposes in respect of such electronic games or digital media. Except for game services software development kits (&quot;Services SDKs&quot;), User may modify the Application. User may otherwise not reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease or lend the Application. It is emphasized that the User shall not be entitled to distribute or transfer in any way (including, without, limitation by way of sublicense) the Application in any other way than as integrated components of electronic games and digital media or in supporting physical marketing materials. Without limitation of the foregoing it is emphasized that User shall not be entitled to share the costs related to purchasing an Application and then let any third party that has contributed to such purchase use such Application (forum pooling).</p><p>User is granted a <u>single seat license</u> to install and use the Application only on a maximum of 2 computers. For the avoidance of doubt, the Application is licensed on a per-seat basis and may not be shared or used concurrently on more than 2 different computers. As an exception, build farm servers and virtual machine instances used only for running, testing, or building projects with the Application do not require separate seat license(s) or constitute use on more than 2 different computers.</p><p>User may use the Application and may have a third party, including any &quot;work-for-hire&quot; contractor or &quot;freelancer&quot; (&quot;Contractor&quot;), work on that Application on its behalf. However, any <u>Contractor working on a project for User must have license(s) of its own</u> to the Application. Conversely, to use the Application, a person must have its own license to the Application, regardless of whether a Contractor working on a project for that person had its own license to that Application. For example, a person who is a Contractor must have a seat license for the Application, and the person who is hirer of the Contractor must have a seat license for the Application.</p><p>Some components of the Application (whether developed by Licensor or third parties) may also be governed by applicable open source software licenses. In the event of a conflict between the applicable EULA and any such open source licenses, the open source software licenses shall prevail with respect to those components.</p><p>User agrees that no modification or use of the Application shall (a) infringe, misappropriate, or violate a third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy; (b) violate, or encourage any conduct that would violate, any applicable law or regulation or would give rise to liability of any kind; (c) be fraudulent, false, misleading, or deceptive.</p><p>All <u>sales are final and there shall be no refunds</u> except as required by law.</p><p>On acceptance of User orders for licenses to the Application, content will be immediately available for download. User expressly consent to the making available of that content immediately upon acceptance of orders. If User is a resident of the European Union and purchases a license to the Application, the right to withdraw from such purchase within 14 days of the date of purchase (&quot;Cooling Off Period&quot;) may be available; however, this right of withdrawal will not apply where performance begins before the end of the Cooling Off Period. Therefore, User expressly agree and understand that if User orders a license to the Application, User’s right of withdrawal is forfeited upon acceptance as performance begins immediately on acceptance.</p><h2 id="modifications-to-application" tabindex="-1">Modifications to Application <a class="header-anchor vp-link" href="#modifications-to-application" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Modifications to Application&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Licensor reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Application or any service to which it connects, with or without notice and without liability to User.</p><h2 id="term-and-termination" tabindex="-1">Term and Termination <a class="header-anchor vp-link" href="#term-and-termination" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Term and Termination&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated by User or Licensor.</p><p>Licensor may, in its sole discretion, at any time and for any or no reason, suspend or terminate this Agreement with or without prior notice.</p><p>This Agreement will terminate immediately, without prior notice from Licensor, in the event that User fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement.
